    "In this notebook, we will go over some of the fundamental python concepts to get started with programming for Colorado RoboSub. If you have not used python notebooks before, you can run a code cell by pressing the play button, or hit `command/control + shift`. Most of you have probably come from CSCI 1300, so you have some basic programming experinece. We will not go over the basic datatypes and classes, but rather the ROS2 API."

    "This section will describe some of the fundamental concepts needed to work with ROS, and how to implement some of that stuff in Python. For more information, please visit the [ROS2 tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html). Note also, unless you have a native Ubuntu installation, the turtlesim tutorial described in the tutorials won't work.\n",

    "### Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a node as a single program. They can do a variety of different things. In the context of the submarine, we have nodes that send a PWM signal to the motors to make them move, a node to take in Joystick input, a node that publishes camera data, etc. Nodes publish data over something called a *topic*. Nodes can also subscribe to topic data, such that it can be manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of topics as the pipes that transport data between programs. A robot can have multiple different nodes running at the same time, but those nodes need to communicate with each other. Described in a little more detail here, we can take our joystick data and publish it over a topic called `/joy`. With another node (a different Python program), we can *subscribe* to the topic and modify that data such that it sends the right data to a `/cmd_vel` topic (another pipe), which then sends the data to yet another node that powers the motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the nodes, when there is a change in some data, will send a *message* to each of their targeted topics.\n",
